###Lesson 4: Responsive Web Design (RWD)

- [First formating in CSS](https://Hannah02.github.io/IxD-302/Bird/index.html)
First attempt at laying out the text of this piece with CSS. This was later scrapped because I thought this flowing design was too complicated and I later used a simpler layout (which you can see in my second attempt, and finished website)


###Lesson 5: Macro- and Micro-Interactions

- Chunking Content -
With regards to chunking content, I had already considered this and integrated it into the design when doing the CSS for this site. Each area is given its own section, heading and subheading. I added my own subheadings to the content to liven it up a little and make the story more memorable.
